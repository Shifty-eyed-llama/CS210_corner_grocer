# CS210_corner_grocer

This project was solving a problem for a small corner grocery store.
The software that they had would print the object name sold in a file, but the only way of counting was by hand.
This program takes that file, adds each individual item to a MAP in C++ and increments the value when that item is found.

This project involved working with MAP in C++, which was new. I read the documentation and played with the code until I was
able to use this feature in this language.

The code would be greatly enhanced by removing code from the main() program. I would have liked to pass things using functions,
however, it turned out to be a bit ambitious passing a MAP as a parameter and I just didn't have time to mess with it.
I would like to refactor this in the future.

I did enjoy the bit about working with the MAP, I have done similar things with dictionaries in javascript and python,
so I felt reasonably prepared for that. More challenging was passing the map as a parameter in a function. I didn't have time
to properly sort this, so I wrote more code in the main() than I would have liked. The C++ documentation and stackoverflow were
helpful when working on these problems.

This class required more documentation than some of the previous classes. I don't feel like this is a bad thing, 
I will have to keep that in mind in future classes as documentation and comments are a large part of writing clean and
maintainable code.
